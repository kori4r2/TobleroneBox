Use the url ```https://github.com/kori4r2/TobleroneBox.git#1.0.0``` and press add

- __Editing the Packages/manifest.json file directly__

Make sure this project is in the dependencies list as shown below and open the project as usual:

    {
      "dependencies": {
        "com.toblerone.toolbox": "https://github.com/kori4r2/TobleroneBox.git#1.0.0"
      }
    }

- __Installing a specific version of the package__

__A version must always be specified__

If you want to install a specific version of the package follow the instructions above, but replace #1.0.0 with the desired version.

The url in the first example would be ```https://github.com/kori4r2/TobleroneBox.git#1.0.2``` for version 1.0.2.
